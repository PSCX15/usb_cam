Hi,

Right now, Like you have mentioned the usb_cam has source code for wet build (catkin build). you just need to do the following to build it from source. (Note: I assume you are using ROS hydro or Indigo, It should work on groovy as well may be you can try it). But all that said, here you go:

$ mkdir -p ~/catkin-ws/src

$ cd ~/catkin-ws/src

$ git clone https://github.com/bosch-ros-pkg/usb_cam.git

$ cd ..

$ catkin_make

$ source ~/catkin-ws/devel/setup.bash

after the above you can verify using ..

$ roscd usb_cam

roscore on a new terminal $ roscore

and then in the terminal where you $ source 'd your usb_cam code run:

$ rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node

Make sure you have your camera connected, before running the above command!!! you view the captured image on rviz,

$ rosrun rviz rviz

hope this helps. mk
